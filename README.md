# Data

The monkey experiments were conducted in Alexa Riehle’s lab at the CNRS Marseille, France, in accordance to European and French government regulations.
Two monkeys, one male (M1) and one female (M2) performed a delayed center-out reaching task, which involved three different task conditions that differed in the amount of initial target information available to the monkey.

## Behavioral task

The monkey was seated in front of a panel featuring a hexagonal array of touch-sensitive target LEDs and a central LED indicating the starting position.
The monkey initiated a trial by touching the central LED (trial start, TS).
During the 1 s delay period starting at t = 500 ms the preparatory signal (PS) provided either complete or incomplete information about the final movement target and consisted of either a single target LED (Condition 1), two adjacent target LEDs (Condition 2), or three adjacent target LEDs (Condition 3) that lit up in green.
At t = 1500 ms the response signal (RS) appeared and one of the green target LEDs turned red.
This indicated the final movement target and prompted the monkey to move his hand to that target.
In Conditions 2 and 3 the final target was randomly chosen among the PS-cued targets, while the other target LEDs went dark.
The times of movement onset (MO) and movement end (ME) were recorded and if the monkey touched the correct target LED, the trial was registered as successful and a drop of juice was given as a reward.
A premature onset of the behavior before RS led to the abortion of the trial and no reward was given.
Only successful trials were analyzed in the present study.
The task conditions of one, two or three possible targets presented during the 1s
preparatory period were executed in blocks.
In each block, 150 trials with randomized target directions were carried out so that each of the directions appeared on average 25 times per condition.
Note that to obtain the same number of possible trial types in all conditions, not all possible combinations of directions for the preparatory stimulus were used in Conditions 2 and 3.
Since six combinations are possible for Condition 1, only the pairs 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 were used in Condition 2 and for Condition 3, only two cases occurred (6-1-2, 3-4-5).

## Recording methods

Extracellular recordings were obtained with a multielectrode microdrive (Reitböck 
system; Thomas Recording) to insert transdurally seven independently movable electrodes within the area of the recording chamber, which was positioned over the motor cortex close to the central sulcus in monkey M1 and slightly more anterior in monkey M2 covering in parts primary and dorsal premotor cortex.
Online spike sorting resulted in up to seven simultaneously recorded single-unit spike trains.
On each recording day, all three conditions were presented to the monkey so that the responses of individual neurons can be compared across conditions.
